## Unreleased

- feat(container): add `register_context` for sync/async context-managed providers with per-scope cleanup (request/session/singleton)
- feat(container): enforce immutable registrations; re-registering the same token raises `ValueError`
- refactor(cleanup): remove broad introspective resource tracking; container now tracks resources registered via `register_context` while request/session scopes continue to clean up scoped resources
- docs: update examples to use `register_context` for cleanup and clarify cleanup model
- tests: refactor to context-managed registrations; fix asyncpg/httpx test indentation
