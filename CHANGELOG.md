## 1.1.0 â€” 2025-09-04

- feat(container): add `register_context` for sync/async context-managed providers with per-scope cleanup (request/session/singleton)
- feat(container): enforce immutable registrations; re-registering the same token raises `ValueError`
- feat(api): add `register_context_sync` and `register_context_async` helpers; typed overloads on `register_context`
- refactor(cleanup): remove broad introspective resource tracking; container now tracks resources registered via context-managed registration while request/session scopes continue to clean up scoped resources
- docs: update examples to use `register_context_sync/async`; clarify nested request scopes and async cleanup ordering
- docs: add LLM Guide for concise usage in agent/tool contexts
- tests: refactor to context-managed registrations; fix asyncpg/httpx test indentation; update circular dependency expectation
