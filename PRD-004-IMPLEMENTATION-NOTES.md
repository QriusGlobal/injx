# PRD-004 Phase 2 Implementation - Completion Report

## Summary
Successfully implemented all Phase 2 optimizations from PRD-004 without any breaking changes to the public API.

## Implemented Changes

### Phase A: Logging Infrastructure ✅
- **Created `src/pyinj/logging.py`**: Centralized logging configuration module
  - Main logger (`pyinj`) for operational events
  - Performance logger (`pyinj.perf`) for metrics
  - `configure_logging()` with default WARNING level
  - Helper functions for resolution paths and performance metrics

- **Enhanced `container.py` with logging**:
  - Container initialization logging (INFO)
  - Registration conflict detection (ERROR) 
  - Resolution path tracking (DEBUG)
  - Circular dependency detection (ERROR)
  - Performance metrics collection with `time.perf_counter()`

- **Added scope transition logging in `contextual.py`**:
  - Scope entry/exit events (INFO)
  - Cleanup failure logging (WARNING with exc_info)

### Phase B: Core Consolidation ✅
- **Removed duplicate classes**:
  - Deleted `CleanupMode` enum (replaced by `CleanupStrategy`)
  - Deleted `_Registration` dataclass (replaced by `ProviderRecord`)

- **Enhanced `ProviderRecord`**:
  - Added `is_async: bool` field (precomputed at registration)
  - Added `dependencies: tuple[Token[object], ...]` field for circular detection
  - Memory usage increased from ~32 to ~56 bytes (acceptable trade-off)

- **Consolidated container dictionaries**:
  - **Before**: 3 separate dicts (`_providers`, `_registrations`, `_token_scopes`)
  - **After**: Single `_registry: dict[Token[object], ProviderRecord[object]]`
  - Reduces memory overhead and lookup complexity
  - Single source of truth for provider metadata

### Phase C: Memory Optimization ✅
- **Verified `ScopeData` optimization**:
  - Already has `slots=True` in dataclass decorator
  - No further changes needed

## Testing & Quality
- All 156 tests pass ✅
- Fixed cycle detection test to use public API
- No performance regressions observed
- Type checking passes with BasedPyright strict mode
- Code formatted and linted with Ruff

## API Compatibility
**No breaking changes to public API**:
- All existing public methods maintain same signatures
- All decorators and injection patterns work unchanged
- Backwards compatible with existing code
- Internal changes transparent to users

## Performance Impact
- **Memory**: Reduced overall memory usage through dictionary consolidation
- **Lookup**: O(1) performance maintained
- **Registration**: Slightly improved with single dictionary update
- **Resolution**: Performance logging added with minimal overhead (lazy evaluation)

## New Public Features
- **`configure_logging(level)`**: Optional logging configuration for debugging
  ```python
  from pyinj.logging import configure_logging
  import logging
  
  # Enable lifecycle logging
  configure_logging(logging.INFO)
  
  # Enable detailed debug logging
  configure_logging(logging.DEBUG)
  ```

## Migration Guide
No migration needed - all changes are internal optimizations.

## Next Steps
The implementation is complete and ready for:
1. Code review
2. Merge to main branch
3. Release as part of next version (likely v1.2.0 given new features)
