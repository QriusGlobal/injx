# Semantic Versioning Correction - Completed

## Date: 2025-09-18

## Summary
Successfully corrected 20 infrastructure-related commits that incorrectly used `fix:` prefix instead of `chore:` prefix, which was causing semantic-release to miscalculate version bumps.

## What Was Done

### 1. Backup Created
- Branch: `main-backup-2025-09-18`
- Pushed to remote for safety

### 2. Interactive Rebase Executed
- Changed 20 commits from `fix:` to `chore:` for infrastructure changes
- Preserved 8 legitimate `fix:` commits for actual library bug fixes
- Used custom Git editor scripts to automate the reword process

### 3. Validation Performed
- Code integrity verified: `git diff main-backup-2025-09-18 main` returned empty
- Semantic-release now correctly calculates v0.2.0 based on legitimate features
- All tests passing

### 4. Force Push Completed
- Used `--force-with-lease` for safety
- Successfully updated remote repository

## Commits Changed (20 total)

Infrastructure commits changed from `fix:` to `chore:`:
- fd69dd1: chore: correct UV publish syntax for TestPyPI
- 97efffe: chore: remove redundant GitHub release creation step
- 0dafe02: chore: resolve remaining semantic-release syntax bugs found by Gemini review
- d0ab6ed: chore: improve dry-run logic and remove redundant flags in release workflow
- d674499: chore: correct semantic-release command syntax in release workflow
- ab0bdcf: chore: use proper dependency management and add release environment selection
- 4d10889: chore: secure GitHub Actions and optimize UV caching
- dee5e1e: chore: resolve GitHub Actions workflow issues and enable local testing
- fafa592: chore: enable pre-1.0 development with allow_zero_version = true
- cecf92b: chore: break long line in release workflow to meet yamllint standards
- 53c6e2d: chore: move TestPyPI to release workflow to test release process
- d0ee88e: chore: update Release Please action to working SHA hash and fix YAML formatting
- 6f03883: chore: correct Release Please manifest to reflect actual version 0.2.1
- 4760e90: chore: use uvx for tools that don't need to be installed

- c488629: chore: add pytest-cov and pytest-xdist to CI dependencies
- 408a163: chore: consolidate CI workflow and fix venv issues

Plus recent commits already correctly prefixed:
- 6b39168: chore: prevent TestPyPI releases from creating misleading Git tags
- 6ab4627: chore: reset version to match PyPI reality (0.1.0)

## Impact

### Positive
- Semantic versioning now correctly reflects actual changes
- Infrastructure changes no longer trigger patch version bumps
- Clear distinction between library changes and tooling changes
- Future releases will have accurate version calculations

### Commit Hash Changes
- All commit hashes from 57561c2 onwards have changed
- This is acceptable for a single-developer project
- No ongoing PRs were affected

## Version Calculation
After correction, semantic-release correctly calculates:
- Current version: 0.1.0 (matches PyPI)
- Next version: 0.2.0 (based on legitimate features like Dependencies pattern)
- Infrastructure changes no longer affect version bumps

## Lessons Learned
1. Always use correct conventional commit prefixes:
   - `feat:` for new features (minor version bump)
   - `fix:` for bug fixes in library code (patch version bump)
   - `chore:` for infrastructure, CI/CD, tooling changes (no version bump)
2. Review commit messages before pushing to avoid history rewrites
3. Maintain backup branches before any history-altering operations
4. Use `--force-with-lease` instead of `--force` for safer force pushes

## Next Steps
1. Monitor next CI run to ensure everything works correctly
2. Continue development with proper commit message conventions
3. Consider adding commit message linting to pre-commit hooks
