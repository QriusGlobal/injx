# 📍 injx Development Roadmap 2025

## Executive Summary

This is the master tracking issue for injx development, covering Python 3.14 readiness, core improvements, and community features. This issue will be automatically updated as related issues and PRs are completed.

## Phase 1: Core Stability & Enhanced API (Current - v0.3.0)

### 🎯 Objective
Improve developer experience and prevent common bugs through intelligent API design.

### ✅ Success Criteria
- [ ] #1 - Fix O(N) canonicalize performance issue
- [ ] #2 - Add strict_mode for explicit token registration
- [ ] #3 - Refactor container.py into focused modules
- [ ] Enhanced Container API with intention-revealing methods
- [ ] Consolidated registry architecture (ProviderSpec pattern)
- [ ] Comprehensive performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Migration guide for breaking changes

**Target Release:** v0.3.0 (Q1 2025)

## Phase 2: Python 3.14 & 3.15 Readiness (Q1-Q2 2025)

### 🎯 Objective
Full compatibility with Python 3.14 and 3.15's paradigm-shifting features.

### ✅ Success Criteria

#### Free-Threading Support (PEP 703)
- [ ] Detect runtime GIL status
- [ ] Implement double-checked locking for singletons
- [ ] Per-token locks instead of global locks
- [ ] Thread sanitizer validation
- [ ] 3-5x speedup for parallel workloads

#### Sub-Interpreter Support (PEP 734)
- [ ] Container blueprint serialization
- [ ] Cross-interpreter container creation
- [ ] Interpreter-singleton scope semantics
- [ ] Queue-based communication patterns

#### Lazy Annotations (PEP 649/749)
- [ ] Zero-overhead annotation evaluation
- [ ] Integration with annotationlib
- [ ] Lazy dependency extraction
- [ ] Performance validation (no regression)

#### Enhanced Type System
- [ ] TypeForm support (PEP 747)
- [ ] TypeIs for type narrowing (PEP 742)
- [ ] Full mypy/pyright strict compliance

#### Python 3.15 Features (As Announced)
- [ ] Track and implement new features as they're announced
- [ ] Ensure continued compatibility with evolving Python internals
- [ ] Performance optimizations for new Python improvements

**Target Release:** v0.4.0 (Q2 2025)

## Phase 3: Developer Experience (Q3 2025)

### 🎯 Objective
Best-in-class developer experience with clear errors and excellent performance.

### ✅ Success Criteria
- [ ] Enhanced error messages with resolution hints
- [ ] Memory optimization (<500 bytes per dependency)
- [ ] Comprehensive thread-safety audit
- [ ] Performance regression prevention system
- [ ] Statistical benchmark validation

**Target Release:** v0.5.0 (Q3 2025)

---

## Phase 4: Community & Ecosystem (Ongoing)

### 🎯 Objective
Build a thriving community with excellent documentation and examples.

### ✅ Success Criteria
- [ ] Real-world usage examples (10+ patterns)
- [ ] Test coverage > 95%
- [ ] Type stub improvements for IDE support
- [ ] Integration guides for popular frameworks
- [ ] Video tutorials and documentation

**Target Release:** Continuous
